<h2>Flickity licenses</h2>

<p>Flickity has three kinds of licenses: open-source, commerical, and OEM.</p>

{{! ----------------------------------------------------------------- }}

<h3>Open source license</h3>

<p>The open source license is designed for you to use Flickity to build open source and personal projects. The Flickity open source license is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3</a>. The GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important is how <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#section5">it is <em>sticky</em> when you distribute your work publicly</a>. From the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">GPL FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Releasing your project that uses Flickity under the GPLv3, in turn, requires your project to be licensed under the GPLv3. If you are okay with this, feel free to use Flickity under the GPLv3, without purchasing a commercial license.</p>

{{! ----------------------------------------------------------------- }}

<h3>Commercial license</h3>

<p>The commercial license is designed to for you to use Flickity in commerical products and applications, without the provisions of the GPLv3. With the commerical license, your code is kept propietary, to yourself. If you want to use Flickity to develop commercial sites, themes, projects, and applications, the commercial license is the appropriate license.</p>

{{! ----------------------------------------------------------------- }}

<h3>Purchasing a commercial license</h3>

<p>Purchasing takes a minute. Our purchasing form accepts credit cards or PayPal. Once purchased, you&rsquo;ll receive a commercial license PDF and you will be all set to use Isotope in your commercial applications. With the purchase of a commercial license:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may use Flickity in as many commercial applications you like.</li>
  <li>You may use Isotope in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium WordPress, Tumblr, or other CMS themes, plugins and templates.</li>
  <li>Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license &mdash; so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with Isotope.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commercial Licenses are priced per developer. A developer is someone on your team working on a project that uses Flickity.</p>

<div class="duo">
  <div class="duo__cell duo__cell--license-option">
    <p>The <strong>Flickity Commercial Developer License</strong> is for individual developers. Each individual developer needs to purchase a separate license.</p>
